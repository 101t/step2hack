# Using Set in math "set theory"

```python
>>> s1 = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
>>> s2 = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

1. Union:

The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both sets), The union is notated A ⋃ B.

```python
>>> s1 | s2 # s1 ∪ s2
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

2. Intersection:

The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets, The intersection is notated A ⋂ B.

```python
>>> s1 & s2 # s1 ∩ s2
{8, 7}
```

3. Symmetric  Difference:

The result is set of all values which are in one of the sets, but not both.

```python
>>> s1 ^ s2 # s1 △ s2
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
```

`s1 △ s2` is also expressed by `(s1 ∪ s2) – (s2 ∩ s1)`

```python
>>> (s1 | s2) - (s1 & s2)
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
```
or

The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set `(s1 – s2) ∪ (s2 – s1)` and is denoted by `s1 △ s2`

```python
>>> (s1 - s2) | (s2 - s1)
{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
```
